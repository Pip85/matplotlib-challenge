# matplotlib-challenge

This challenge included looking at results from mouse studies on squamous cell carcinoma tumor volumes across several drug regimens.  
The study is sponsored by Pymaceuticals, who is looking at the efficacy of their drug Capomulin.
The challenge involved cleaning the data for duplicate mouse information.
A comparison table of statistical measures, mean, median, variance, standard deviation and SEM was prepared using two different coding methods.
Bar charts comparing total measurements in each of the drug regimens was prepared using two different plotting methods.
Pie charts comparing the percentage of female vs male mice were included using two different plotting methods.
Four promising drug regimens, including Capomulin, were examined using final tumor volume measurements taken over the 45 day study.
Statistical measures including quartiles, iqr and lower/upper bounds were quantitatively calculated.  Outliers were also revealed in one of the drug regimens, Infubinol.
Statitical measures and outliers were plotted in a box plot for better visualization.
One mouse was chosen from the Capomulin and a plot of tumor volume over the 45 day study was created.  While Capomulin seems successful overall, this particular mouse's tumor volume increased over the study.
A scatter plot was generated to show the average tumor volume compared by mouse weight for Capomulin.
That same scatter plot was regenerated to show the linear regression and the correlation coefficient was calculated.
Based on the correlation coefficient and the plotted linear regression equation, there does seem to be a linear correlation between average tumor volume and weight in Capomulin.
